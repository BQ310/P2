Experiment two involves pitting the modifified mcts vs the vanilla mcts with a varying number of 
tree nodes for both bots. The expected outcome is that the modified mcts will have a greater outcome 
at all tree nodes since the heuristic will provide it better odds of simulating meaningful events. However, 
as the number of tree nodes reaches exhaustion both bots will behave simularly. The results show that 
the modified mcts performs better than the vanilla bot at every amount of tree nodes. This difference in wins 
is variable but is consistently always positive in favor of the modified bot. With an increase in tests, it the 
difference between modified and vanilla will likely approach some meaningful value.
