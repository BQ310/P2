In experiment 1, the mcts vanilla bot goes against another mcts vanilla bot with a different tree size. 
In this case, player one is constantly kept at a tree size of 100 nodes while player 2 is variable.
The expected result is that an increase in tree nodes will lead to a higher win count since the mcts
will have more information to choose a better action. This hypothesis is enforced by the results which 
show an increase in wins for player 2 as the number of tree nodes increases. Noticeably, the results seem 
to be logarithmic in that increasing the number of tree nodes does always provide the same return in wins. 
At the number of tree nodes increases, the number of wins gained decreases. This makes sense because inevitably,
the mcts is not exhaustive and therefore is always prone to some losses.
